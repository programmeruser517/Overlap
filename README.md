# Overlap

AI agents negotiate availability to find the best meeting time.

## Core Demo
- Multiple users join a room
- Each user provides availability
- Each user has an AI agent
- Agents negotiate until they agree on a time
- Users can watch the agent conversation live

## Non-goals (for hackathon)
- No calendar integrations
- No auth
- No time zones
- No recurring meetings
